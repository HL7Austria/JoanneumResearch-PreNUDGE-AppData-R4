This IG will show how to use the PreNUDGE FHIR API to deliver health indicators as an application provider.

We will focus on fully specifying four PreNUDGE measurements:
- Daily activity as Steps (per day, coming from a questionnaire)
- Daily activity as Steps (per day, coming from a wearable device)
- Alcohol Amount consumed as Number of drinks (per day/week)
- Quality of life (score)

Additional PreNUDGE measurements can be specified and will be listed here.

### Project

The PreNUDGE project is an Austrian FFG funded research initiative.

In german, **PräNUDGE** stands for:

**Prä**vention und Gesundheitsförderung durch intelligente  
**Nu**tzung von  
**D**aten und Innovationen zur Stärkung der  
**Ge**sundheitskompetenz  

Translated to English, this means: 

Prevention and Health Promotion through Intelligent  
Use of  
Data and Innovations to Strengthen  
Health Literacy  

#### Why

We aim for Austria to **stay healthy longer**.

To achieve this, health indicators of the Austrian population should be systematically collected and made available for evidence-based prevention.

#### What

We will focus on:
- Investigation of motivational factors and incentivization measures (nudging) for participation and adherence to prevention programs
- Definition of a standardized set of health indicators for prevention work and analyses for 4 disease entities
- Development of a platform for creating health profiles of Austrian citizens
- Establishment of an ecosystem of app providers for collecting health indicators: interface between citizens and platform
- Making the platform accessible for primary and secondary data use
- Ensuring sustainable utilization
